                                    Basic Concepts In Angluar
                                ---------------------------------

                            1. Module - To import 3rd party libraries, also used to hold components, Root Module : AppModule
                            2. Component - html,css,ts, also have a selector, Root Component : AppComponent
                            3. Selector - to replace Selector tag with its html page
                            4. Decorator - To hold meta data, starts with @
                            5. Set up path for component - to view component in another webpage
                                - Use app.routingmodule.ts file
                                - Use router-outlet selector in root component(AppComponent) - To navigate according to the user requested path
                            6. Data Binding : data sharing within a component
                                6.1 One way Binding : data sharing in one direction
                                    6.1.1 ts (component) to html file (view)
                                        6.1.1.1 String Interpolation : {{class property-name}}
                                        6.1.1.2 property binding : [attribute-name]="property-name"
                                    6.1.2 html (view) to ts (component)
                                        6.1.2.1 Event binding : (event-name)="function call"
                                        6.1.2.2 Event binding using $event : (event-name)="function call($event)"
                                        6.1.2.3 Event binding using template reference variable: #variable-name
                                6.2 Two way binding : data sharing in both direction
                                    6.2.1 ngModel: Import FormsModule in AppModule
                                            [(ngModel)]="class property"
                            7. Angluar Forms

                            8. Dependency Injections: To share data between dependent classes
                                - constructor(access-specifier variable-name:class name){ }
                            9. Angluar Services : To share common logic with components
                            10. Angluar Directives : DOM manipulation
                                10.1 Component Directive
                                10.2 Structural Directive
                                    - *ngFor = "let variable-name of array-name"
                                10.3 Attribute Directive: to apply style to html elements
